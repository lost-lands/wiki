## Committing
ALL changes should be made to their own branch. Repo maintainers should only ever make minor changes directly to the `master` branch.

## `gh-pages` branch
This branch is deployed using Github Pages to [https://wiki.lostlands.org](https://wiki.lostlands.org). Changes pushed to the `master` branch are automatically built using [this github action](https://github.com/lost-lands/wiki/blob/master/.github/workflows/publish.yml)
