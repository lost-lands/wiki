# Special Use Districs
Special use districs are designated, protected areas on the server which provide some sort of service to the entire community. In the future, anyone will be
able to apply for an area to become a special use district. Upon approval, a WorldGuard protected region
will be created, and the applicant will have control over that region (so that they may add/remove players and modify flags).

## Guidelines
- The area MUST provide a beneficial service to the community
- The area should always be accessible to everyone
- Mixed use cases are permissiable (such as residential and shops together)

## Use Cases/Ideas
- Mob farm
- Shopping distric
- Parkour course
- Event arena
