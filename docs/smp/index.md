# SMP Wiki
Welcome the the SMP wiki. For now, this is the default server players are connected to when joining Lost Lands. This may change in the future as we expand, but the SMP will always be joinable.

## New Players
New players are considered guests and are not able to place/destroy blocks or interact with mobs. To become a player, please [apply using this link](https://lostlands.org/apply). The application is extremely short and just meant to be a way to prevent a huge influx of players (or bots) modifying the world.
