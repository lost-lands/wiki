# Claims

## Selecting a Region
Start by obtaining a wand using `/claim tool`. If you are familiar with WorldEdit selections, you can proceed using that knowledge. 
If not, the objective is to select two positions which will form a cube. To create your first selection, left click a block with the tool.
To create your second selection, right click a block with the tool.

### Verifying your Selection
If you've successfully created a selection, you can run `//size` to get the amount of blocks in that section.

## Creating a Claim
Once you have created a selection, simply run the command `/claim create <name>`, where name is what you want to call it.

## Deleting a Claim
To delete a claim, run the command `/claim delete <name>`

## Trusting Players
Trusting players gives them full access to your claim, apart from locked items. To trust a player, run the command
`/claim trust add <claim> <player>` where claim is your claim name, and player is the player you want to trust. If you wish
to remove a player from your claim, run `/claim trust remove <claim> <player>`.
