# Gameplay Changes/Additions

## Sleep
The night can be quickly skipped if at least 33% of players are sleeping. 

## Mining
The server uses the [VeinMiner](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/veinminer.12038/) plugin. This allows players to sneak (crouch) while mining to mine an entire vein of ore at once. A player's hunger and tool will be proportionally decreased with the size of the vein.

## Tree Chopping
When using an axe, players can take down an entire tree by breaking the bottom block. You can toggle this functionality by using the `/treeassist toggle` command.

## Spawner Harvesting
Mob spawners may be obtained by using a silk touch pickaxe to break a spawner. This drop a spawner with the same mob type, which can then be placed elsewhere.

## AFK/Idling
For now, all players are able to AFK on the server for as long as they'd like. After 5 minutes of inactivity, the server will automatically mark them as AFK, and hostile mobs will not target that player. <br /><br />

Please be aware that this may change in the future if there is a higher demand for playing the server. Regular players may be limited to a certain amount of time they can AFK before getting kicked, or might not be able to AFK at all.
