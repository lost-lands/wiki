# Privacy

## Server Software
Lost Lands does not collect any additional user information outside of what the vanilla minecraft server, bukkit, spigot, paper, or purpur collect. 

## Chat Reporting
We are proud to use the [No Chat Reports](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/no-chat-reports-1-19-1-19-x.102931/) plugin on Lost Lands. We not only believe our moderation staff is capable of handling chat without Mojang intervention, but we firmly disagree with system Mojang has put into place.
